Sales Logistics:
    Delivery from Warehouse to Wholesalers, Retailers, and Consumers
Distribution logisticians essentially pursue three goals:
GOALS:
    1. Availability: ensure that a sufficient quantity of products is available to customers. Customers should be able to receive goods promptly and without great effort.
    2. Cost minimization: The aim is to reduce costs associated with transport, storage, shortage and order processing. At the same time, however, delivery is to become faster, more energy-efficient and more environmentally friendly.
    3. Influence: Distribution logisticians want to have the highest possible say in the marketing of their products, for instance. It is about answering the questions of “How are my products placed on the sales shelf?” and “How can I stand out from the competition with the presentation of my goods?”.
FLOW:
Place an order, process order, bill and send, make payment and deliver, track delicery. confirm delivery.
